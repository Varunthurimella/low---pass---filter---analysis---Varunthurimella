By using the wavegen tool in waveforms to generate the sine waves at multiple frequencies like 100 Hz,500 Hz,1 kHz,2 kHz, 5kHz and 10 kHz. 
And then by using oscilloscope and in measurement section for both channels i added peak to peak voltage and then i started recording above mentioned frequencies.
Next i have calculated the gain (vout/vin) and gain(db) also with these values i have wrote the code in spyder software to generate the plotes
Actually i have done in demo mode so the input and voltage outputs are not accurate so for real values or the values which may come during fixed RC low pass filter i used those values also to check how it will work 
In this i observed that the input waveforms remains constant in amplitude for all the test frequencies and the output waveforms shows higher amplitude at low frequencies and gradually decreases as frequency increases
